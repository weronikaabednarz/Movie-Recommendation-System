# Movie Recommendation System

The movie recommendation system is used to predict or filter users' film preferences based on their previous decisions and actions. 
Project based on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
 
Window application:
- allows you to enter a movie title,
- shows suggested films,
- verifies the entered data - in the case of entering a title which does not exist in the database, the following information pops up.

Technologies used in the project are *Jupyter Notebook & Python* with imports:
- pandas - to manipulate and analyse data,
- numpy - a library for scientific calculations, operations on multidimensional arrays and matrices,
- tkinter - to create a graphical user interface,
- ast - to analyse and process expressions
- CountVectorizer (from sklearn.feature_extraction.text) - to convert a set of text documents into a matrix of numbers
- nltk - to natural language processing,
- cosine_similarity (from sklearn.metrics.pairwise) - to calculate cosine similarity between feature vectors.
